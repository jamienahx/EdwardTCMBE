## Background 
Edward TCM is a newly opened TCM provider aiming to raise awareness and draw customers to their offerings. 

While their physical offerings such as location, interior and storefront marketing are appealing and well-executed, their online presence would benefit from improvements in their website/ online presence.

In addition to revamping the front end user interface, an admin portal is created to allow the client to be able to perform CRUD functionalities for their offerings directly to the backend database through an online interface.
